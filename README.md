# TOTOR-Bot
###### Bot Language: Python

## Description
A bot for a Star Wars RP discord. 

## Commands this bot will have:
- Related Shop Embeds
- Reset Roles and Nickname (for changing characters)
- Server Rules (command to show a single server rule in any channel. 

## Possible Future Commands:
- Moderation Commands
- Experience / Levelling commands

### I do not intend to implement commands from the possible section as this is purely supposed to be a bot to assist in some mundane server tasks for users who want to change thier rp character upon character death or story arc completion.
