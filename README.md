# QARAK-Bot
###### Bot Language: Python

## Description
A bot for a DnD Campaign Discord 

## Commands this bot will have:
- Scheduling Commands


## Possible Future Commands:
- Character Stats / Character Sheet stats
- Useful Info commands

### I do not intend to implement commands from the possible section as this is purely supposed to be a bot to assist in some mundane server tasks for users who want to change thier rp character upon character death or story arc completion.
